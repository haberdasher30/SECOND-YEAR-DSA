QUEUE IMPLEMENTATION USING CIRCULAR ARRAY (An array is called
circular if we consider the first element as next of the last element).
Write a C/C++ program to perform the following actions on a QUEUE implemented using
arrays / array of structures / array-lists (which is viewed circularly) :
1) Implement ENQUEUE(o) operation in a QUEUE for N (N >= 5) STUDENT
RECORDS. Each STUDENT RECORD should store
a. <IDNO, NAME, DOB,CGPA>.
b. You have to read each STUDENT record from an input file “studentin.dat”
stored locally in your directory and insert it into the queue, one at a time.
(You can use vi editor to create input data file. Make sure that the input data
file contains at least 5 records).

2) Implement the DEQUEUE() operation for the QUEUE in FIFO order and display
all the records on the standard output (screen display). Also, write the output results
into an external file “studentout.dat”.
3) Display the student names (NAME field) whose CGPA is less than 9.
